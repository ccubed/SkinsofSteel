			<desc>Systems with this keyword may be pushed beyond their limits. Systems (or subsystems) with this keyword operate normally unless more power is allocated to it through Power Redistribution or similar effects. If sufficient power is allocated to the System, the item may operate as if it had purchased the System an additional time beyond what it was designed. Whenever doing so, the item suffers 1 Bashing damage per DV-Refresh.</desc>

			<desc>This chassis is little more than a magical frame to attach Systems onto, and even then, ST's should feel free to rule that a system cannot be installed onto just a framework (such as the Aquatics System, which cannot be installed on a suit without a proper seal). This chassis is inexpensive and innocuous, costing 1 fewer dot of Resources to construct. Additionally, clothing or armor may be worn over the chassis. Armor worn over the chassis adds the fatigue and mobility penalties of both armors and then increases them by 3</desc>

			<name>Machine Intelligences</name>
			<desc>During the First Age, the Solars continued to push the boundaries of what magitech could accomplish and with it the power of magitech armor. The single greatest advance in the utility of these suits of battle was the Essence-powered systems that raised the armor's least god from a quiescent entity without name or ability into an active, guiding force, a companion and ally for the user.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Known as Material Intelligences, or MIs, these awakened gods are not as puissant as those that sometimes survive within manses or the more massive artifact vessels, but they are nonetheless a potent asset upon the battlefield. Even the least among them can provide power to Essence weapons and alert the pilot to danger, while the greatest can take physical form and fight beside their pilots.</desc>

			<name>Servitor Ghosts</name>
			<desc>A more recent innovation and one with a more sinister bent, is the creation of ghostly servitors to act in place of a armor's AI. Because the creation of an AI requires the consent of Heaven, the Deathlords are unable to create AIs to empower their greatest armor and so have turned to new avenues of experimentation in order to fill their needs. The result was the birth of the first ghost servitor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A ghost servitor was once a free-willed ghost, captured and then stripped of much of what gave it form, distilled down to just an intelligent pattern of Essence before being infused into the circuitry of a armor. Needless to say, this process is not pleasant for the ghost in question. Many are rendered near catatonic by the procedure. The resulting SG functions like an AI. The process cannot be performed on ghosts with Essence 4+, only the younger ghosts need worry about suffering this particular torment</desc>

			<desc>The Primordials have known how to reshape spirits since time immemorial, but recently they and their souls have started to use this skill to convert spirits into forms that resemble MI's for their Chosen of Hell.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Normally, each RSS is a reshaped god, elemental, or demon, boiled in vitrol and molded like clay before being heated and melted and poured into the circuitry of the armor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, this is not the defining attribute of an RSS. The reshaping referred to in the name of this type of MI is in truth, the forcing of a spirit to assume a compressed state which straddles the lines of both the immaterial and the material, entrapped in the armors circuitry.</desc>

The would-be pilot and the AI make opposed Willpower rolls, adding their Essence in automatic successes.

This Charm does not work on the current pilot. Should the current pilot be a Celestial Exalt, this Charm will also not work on his next incarnation, provided no others successfully attune to the warstrider in the intervening time.</desc>

			<desc>Normally, the essence flows of an item can only hold so much power before it begins to damage it. This is the cause of the limit of repurchases of a System. However, by ignoring these limits, more power may be pushed into the system to the detriment of the item. Every purchase of OverDrawn Systems allows the designer to purchase one System of their choice an additional time past its normal limit. This system may not affect Systems with the Stackable keyword unless they fall under Enhancement or Movement Systems.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note: OverDrawn Systems and systems with the Overdrive keyword are not the same thing. OverDrawn systems require a copy of this system for each copy of an OverDrawn system beyond the normal limits -- (Artifact rating) for most artifacts, or (Artifact rating x 3) for vehicles -- effectively imposing a 2 AP surcharge on each system beyond the normal limit, and the number of copies of OverDrawn Systems is also subject to the (Artifact rating) or (Artifact rating x 3) copies limit. It cannot OverDraw itself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Overdrive keyword, meanwhile, does not require additional copies to be purchased, but instead allows the item to temporarily create one additional copy of the system it applies to. It must commit an amount of Sustained Power equal to the system's AP cost in order to create the temporary copy, and every DV-refresh that the temporary copy is active, the item takes one level of unsoakable bashing damage.</desc>

			<desc>This System must be applied to a set of artifacts. This system requires both Transforming Systems with an alternate form worth 0 AP. This system must be installed on all of the artifacts in the set.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This set of artifacts may transform and combine into a single, larger artifact. This larger artifact has the Artifact rating of the highest rating of the artifacts that combine to make it. This combined artifact has additional AP equal to the Artifact ratings of all of the artifacts that combine to make it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Generally, this System is only applied to vehicles or Warstriders, as the Linking Systems cover most other requirements of combining artifacts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This combining takes a special Coordinated Attack (Speed 12, DV -3) action from all participants. Separating is a Miscellaneous (Speed 3, DV -0) action that may be initiated by any of the pilots/participants. All of the artifacts must be able to reach one another within the given amount of time. If any of the artifacts suffers knockdown or knockback during this action, the combination is interrupted.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The size of the resulting artifact depends on the size differences between the combining artifacts. If all of the artifacts are the same size category, then the resulting artifact is that size category + 1. Should one of the artifacts be a size category larger than the all of the other artifacts combining, the resulting artifact is that size category.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Normally, when an unworn artifact and worn artifact combine, the resulting artifact is a worn artifact such as Powered Armor or Mechanized Armor, but this is not a hard, fast rule and is in truth, at the discretion of the designer.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The combined artifact is designed separately from it’s component artifacts. The combined artifact must have the Additional Pilots system enough times to support all of its pilots as necessary. Other than this, the only hard rule is that the combined artifact may not have Integrated Artifacts if none of its component artifacts has that artifact. Armors should be built from General Systems, Enhancement Systems, and the Systems of its component armors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some general rules of thumb for the creation of the larger artifact: If you add systems that the component artifacts do not have, try to stick to the ones that have the Hardy tag, as they are the easiest to justify. Try to decide why the artifacts should be split, why they should be combined, and design the artifacts involved with that in mind. The combined artifacts can have multiple pilots and all the advantages that come with, take advantage of this!</desc>

Each point of Sustained Power provided to the system reduces the activation cost by 2m.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Reduce Gravity: Multiply jump distances/movement speeds by 1.5, but increase the Difficulty of knockback and knockdown effects by 1. Each additional repurchase increases these by .5 and 1 respectively.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Negate Gravity: It does exactly what it says. While this has few mechanical impacts (outside of the obvious), the stunting potential is great. Assume that a character not under the effects of gravity and without something to brace themselves against suffers a -3 External Penalty to all physical actions. This system may only affect things of up to Size Category (total purchases).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Enhance Gravity: Divide movement speeds by 2.

			<desc>The poison is linked to the material the artifact is constructed out of. This subsystem may only be purchased for artifacts that grant a magical material bonus. This has an effect based on the material the artifact is made from a follows:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Orichalcum: The poison is capable of harming Creatures of Darkness that are otherwise immune to poison. The poison does Aggravated damage to said creatures.[NEWLINE]Moonsilver: The poison may inflict points of negative mutations rather than damage. Characters who are benefiting from the artifacts Moonsilver bonus may choose the mutations inflicted. One point of mutations for every level of damage the poison would inflict.[NEWLINE]Jade: The poison may cause the loss of memory. Instead of dealing damage, the poison knocks the character out (Provided they were unable to resist the poison’s toxicity). More importantly, they forget the last (Artifact Rating) minutes experienced per dose of poison. Victims placed into slumber by this can be roused normally with only mild shaking and automatically awaken if attacked (and may subsequently act normally), but waking up does not restore lost memories. On their own, victims sleep for an hour before rousing. This poison affects only the living.[NEWLINE]Starmetal: The poison may instead make the character suggestible. For every level of damage the character would suffer, they instead suffer -1 Internal Penalty to their MDVs for one hour. This poison may affect living and spiritual beings alike.[NEWLINE]Soulsteel: The poison may force victims to feel soul-numbing despair and horror, reducing all Virtues by one dot for the next day (to a minimum of one dot). Multiple doses are cumulative for assessing penalties. Characters behave according to their penalized Virtues, and any mortal reduced to Valor 1 by the venom will flee screaming, curl up in a fetal position or commit suicide as appropriate to temperament and stimulus. Moonshadow Caste ambassadors sometimes covertly deliver this venom with a handshake, weakening the resolve of those against whom they must debate. This venom can affect the living and ghosts, but not other spirits.[NEWLINE]Helltech: The poison is not truly poison, but rather, impure Vitrol. All beings, even those otherwise immune to poison, suffer from it. The damage is Aggravated to Gods, Elementals, and Demons. Such beings killed by the venom instead melt into chalcanth or azoth as appropriate. This Vitrol loses its potency at the end of the scene.</desc>
